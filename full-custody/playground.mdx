If you have already opened an account on Cobo Custody and obtained an API key ([How to get API key](/full-custody/authentication)),
all you need to do is enter your API key in the "PRIVATE-KEY" field in the Playground.
Then, fill in the API parameters and click on "Send Request" to view the API response.
Currently, the API Playground only supports the development environment.
