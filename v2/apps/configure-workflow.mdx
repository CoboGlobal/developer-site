This section introduces how to configure approval workflows for your Cobo Portal Apps.

In the context of Cobo Portal Apps, an approval workflow consists of specific operations on the app, such as submitting a transaction or initiating a payout, that will trigger certain approval rules. When users install an app, the app will be automatically configured with default approval workflows, which are defined in the app manifest file. For more details about how the approval workflow affects the app UI, refer to <a href="https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/portal-apps/workflow">View and update approval workflows</a>.

You can configure the default approval workflow for your app in the `operation_approval_rules` field in the app manifest file. The following is an example of the `operation_approval_rules` object. This object is defined in the [Batch Payout](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/batch-payouts/introduction) app's manifest file, which configures the default approval workflow for the app. If you make a batch payout in the Batch Payout app, and the payout amount is greater than $100, you will trigger an approval workflow in which the batch payout requires approval from one organization admin. The payout request will be in the Pending Approval status until an admin approves or rejects.
