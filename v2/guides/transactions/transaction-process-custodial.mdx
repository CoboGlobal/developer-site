This article explains how deposit and withdrawal transactions are processed for Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets). It outlines the steps taken by you and Cobo, along with the various transaction statuses and sub-statuses your transaction might go through. You can call [Get transaction information](/v2/api-references/transactions/get-transaction-information) to query the current status and sub-status of your transaction.

## Deposit process

The following diagram illustrates how a deposit into your Custodial Wallet (Asset Wallet) is processed:

- Cobo reserves the right to reject a deposit transaction if it violates compliance regulations. If rejected, the deposit will not appear on Cobo Portal or trigger any webhook events.
- If the transaction amount is below the minimum deposit threshold, the transaction will not be processed and no record will be created. You can call the [Get token information](/v2/api-references/wallets/get-token-information) operation to retrieve the minimum deposit amount for each token type.

## Withdrawal process

The following diagram illustrates how a withdrawal from your Custodial Wallet (Asset Wallet) is processed:

- If a withdrawal is rejected or unsuccessful, the tokens will be returned to your wallet, and your balance will remain unchanged.
- If your withdrawal amount is smaller than the minimum withdrawal threshold, the withdrawal request will receive an error. You can call the [Get token information](/v2/api-references/wallets/get-token-information) operation to retrieve the minimum withdrawal amount for each token type.
