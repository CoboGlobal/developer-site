WaaS 2.0 defines a range of transaction statuses and sub-statuses to reflect different processing stages. This page provides a complete list of statuses and describes the actions you can perform based on each status.

## Status reference table

The table below provides a complete overview of all transaction statuses and their corresponding sub-statuses in the WaaS 2.0 service.
