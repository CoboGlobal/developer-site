This article lists the essential concepts and terms used in the Developer Hub.

| Term                      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Asset                     | (This concept only applies to exchange wallets) A digital representation of a valuable resource on a blockchain network. Exchange wallets group your holdings by asset, even if the same asset exists on different blockchains. For example, if your Exchange Wallet has 1 Bitcoin on Ethereum and 1 Bitcoin on its native chain, then your asset balance is 2 Bitcoin. |
| Chain                     | The specific blockchain network on which an asset or token resides. To learn more about the supported chains, see [Supported tokens and chains](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/supported-tokens-custodial). |
| Token                     | A specific type of cryptocurrency. Wallets track your balance for each individual token. To learn more about the supported tokens, see [Supported tokens and chains](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/supported-tokens-custodial). |
| API key                   | A unique identifier used to authenticate and authorize API requests. An API key allows an organization to initiate specific actions such as withdrawals. To learn how to create an API key, see [API keys](). |
| Organization/Org          | Organization serves as the cornerstone for streamlined account management. The admin of the organization has the exclusive rights to manage user profiles, designate roles, assign permissions, and enforce governance policies. To learn more about organizations, see [Introduction to Organization](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/organization/introduction). |
| Address                   | A unique identifier on a blockchain network used to send and receive cryptocurrency or other digital assets. It is recommended that you use a dedicated address for transactions of one token for MPC Wallets. |
| Cancel                    | Revoke a pending transaction before it is broadcast on the blockchain. |
| Drop                      | Revoke a pending transaction before it is added to a block on the blockchain. Dropping a transaction will trigger a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction, which allows you to replace your unconfirmed transaction with a new one with a higher transaction fee. |
| Speed up                  | Increase the transaction fee associated with a pending transaction to incentivize miners to prioritize it and confirm it faster. Speeding up a transaction will also trigger an RBF transaction. |
| Resend                    | Re-broadcast a transaction that hasn't been confirmed on the blockchain after a certain amount of time. Resending a transaction initiates a new attempt to process the transaction that failed previously. |
| Replace                   | Create a new transaction that cancels a pending transaction and has a higher transaction fee to expedite confirmation. |
| Contract call transaction | A transaction that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the blockchain. It typically involves transferring funds to the smart contract address and specifying the calldata that contains the function name and any required parameters. |
| Message sign transaction  | A transaction that cryptographically signs a message using your private key to prove ownership of a specific blockchain address. The signed message can be used for various purposes including verifying ownership and authorizing actions. |
| Source                    | For a transaction, the source refers to the party that initiates the transaction. It can be a Custodial Wallet, an MPC Wallet, a Smart Contract Wallet, an Exchange Wallet, a Fee Station, or an external address. In a token transfer, the source refers to the sending address. |
| Destination               | For a transaction, the destination refers to the party that receives the transaction. It can be a Custodial Wallet, an MPC Wallet, a Smart Contract Wallet, an Exchange Wallet, an external address, a message to be signed, or a smart contract. In a token transfer, the destination refers to the deposit address. |
| Transaction fee           | A fee paid to miners or validators on a blockchain network to process and confirm a transaction. Transaction fee varies based on the fee model that the chain uses. They must be paid in the native currency of the blockchain. |
| Transaction fee price     | The per-unit fee or price charged for a transaction.         |
| Fee token                 | The token used to pay for a transaction fee, that is, the native currency of the blockchain. |
| Fee Station               | A service that automatically pays certain types of fees including transaction fees for all the users under the Organization. |
