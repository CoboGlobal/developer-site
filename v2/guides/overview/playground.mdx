The API Playground is a web-based tool designed for developers looking to explore and experiment with the Cobo WaaS 2.0 API directly within the Developer Hub, all within the browser.

### Overview

The API Playground consists of two main parts:

- Request composer located in the center. It allows easy modification of the authorization header, path parameters, query parameters, and request body as needed.
- Request viewer and response viewer located on the right. They display sample request bodies and response bodies in all supported languages. The request viewer updates in real-time as you make changes in the request composer.

### Prerequisites

To use the API Playground, ensure the following:

- Create and configure your Cobo Account for the development environment. For instructions on creating and setting up a Cobo Account, see [Cobo Account Setup]().
- Generate an API key specifically for the development environment and configure it on Cobo Portal. For instructions on generating and setting up an API key, see [API Key Setup]().

**Note:**
- Cobo Accounts and API keys intended for production environments are not compatible with the API Playground.
- For security reasons, never disclose your API Secret in the API Playground.

### Test an API endpoint

1. Select the API endpoint you wish to test.
2. Modify the request as follows:
   - Enter your private key into the `BIZ-API-KEY` field under the Authorization header.
   - Add path parameters or query parameters for a GET operation, or include the request body for a POST operation if required.
3. Click the **Send** button to submit the request.

Upon successful submission, the response viewer will display the actual response returned by the API.
