This article is targeted at WaaS 1.0 users who are considering upgrading to WaaS 2.0. It introduces the benefits of the upgrade and provides step-by-step instructions to successfully complete the upgrade process.

## Key enhancements in WaaS 2.0

WaaS 2.0 is a major upgrade from WaaS 1.0, designed to support diverse Web3 scenarios such as payments, tokenization, and automated fund management. It enables enterprises and developers to build Web3 applications more efficiently and cost-effectively.

The three core benefits of upgrading to WaaS 2.0 are:

- **Enhanced capabilities**: Introduces new modules including Payment Solutions, Tokenization, Fee Station, Auto-sweep, Travel Rule, and more.
- **More efficient development**: A unified API architecture reduces the number of API calls required to accomplish the same functionality, lowering integration and maintenance complexity.
- **Improved operations**: Upgraded webhook functionality supports more event types and provides built-in tools such as logs, retries, and simulated testing, enhancing observability and debugging efficiency.

For a complete introduction to WaaS 2.0, see [Introduction to WaaS 2.0](/v2/guides/overview/introduction).

The following table summarizes the key enhancements introduced in WaaS 2.0 compared with WaaS 1.0:

| Dimension       | WaaS 1.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | WaaS 2.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Upgrade to 2.0

This section introduces the detailed steps to upgrade from WaaS 1.0 to 2.0.

### Prerequisites

Reach out to our support team at[ help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com) to migrate from Cobo Custody to Cobo Portal.

### Get started with WaaS 2.0

Follow the instructions in [Send your first request](/v2/guides/get-started/get-started-with-waas) to set up your account, create and register your API key, integrate a WaaS SDK if necessary, and send your first API request to the WaaS 2.0 service.

### Rewrite your code

Once you complete the initial setup, it is time to rewrite your code by replacing the 1.0 API operations with 2.0 operations. Refer to[ API operation comparison](#api-operation-comparison) for a detailed comparison between 1.0 and 2.0 API operations.

You can also refer to [Get started with Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets)](/v2/guides/custodial-wallets/get-started-asset-wallets) for a step-by-step guide on how to create a Custodial Wallet (Asset Wallet), generate wallet addresses, and receive and withdraw tokens. Guides for other wallet types will be available in the future.

### Set up webhook and callback endpoints

Set up the webhook and callback endpoints and register them in Cobo Portal. 

To understand webhook events, callback messages, and the differences in webhook/callback mechanisms between WaaS 1.0 and WaaS 2.0, refer to [Introduction to webhooks and callbacks](/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/introduction).

To learn the detailed steps of the setup, see [Set up a callback or webhook endpoint](/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/set-up-endpoint). To register the endpoint, see [Register a webhook endpoint](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/developer-console/webhooks-create) and [Register a callback endpoint](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/developer-console/callbacks-register).

<Note>The endpoints you set up for WaaS 1.0 will not receive any messages from the WaaS 2.0 service.</Note>
