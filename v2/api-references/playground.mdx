The API Playground is a web-based tool designed for developers looking to explore and experiment with the Cobo WaaS 2.0 API directly from the Developer Hub, all within the browser.

## Prerequisites

Before using the API Playground, make sure you have completed the following:
- Set up your Cobo Account and create the required API key and API secret. For instructions, see [Set up Cobo Accounts](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/accounts/sign-up) and [Generate an API key and an API secret](/v2/guides/overview/cobo-auth#generate-an-api-key-and-an-api-secret).
- Register the API key on Cobo Portal based on the environment that you use. For more details, refer to [Register the API key](/v2/guides/overview/cobo-auth#register-the-api-key) and [Environments](/v2/guides/overview/environments).

## Steps

1. Go to any API operation in the API Reference and click **Try it**.

   The API Playground panel will appear, showing a request editor, sample codes for different programming languages, and a response viewer.

2. Modify the request as follows:

   - In the **Authorization** section, enter your API secret into the `BIZ-API-KEY` field.
      <Note>For API requests sent via the API Playground, you only need to provide your API secret in the request headers. However, for actual API requests, you need to provide your API key, a nonce, and an API signature as request headers. For more details, see [Authentication](/v2/guides/overview/cobo-auth). </Note>
   - Set the path parameters, query parameters, and request body as needed.

3. Choose the API base URL that you want to send requests to:
   - Development environment: https://api.dev.cobo.com/v2/
   - Production environment: https://api.cobo.com/v2/

   You can switch between development and production directly in the API Playground by clicking the arrow icon next to the base URL.

   <Note> For security reasons, it is strongly recommended to use the development environment for testing purposes. For more information about differences between the development and production environments, see [Environments](/v2/guides/overview/environments).</Note>

4. Click the **Send** button to submit the request.

Upon successful submission, you will find the response returned from the WaaS service in the response viewer.
