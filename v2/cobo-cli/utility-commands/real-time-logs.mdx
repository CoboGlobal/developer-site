title: Real-time Logs
---

The Cobo CLI provides a powerful feature to tail real-time logs of your API
requests. This is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring your API
usage in real-time.

## Tailing Logs

To start tailing logs, use the `logs tail` command:

```bash
$ cobo logs tail
```

This command will start streaming logs in real-time. Each log entry will display
detailed information about the API request, including the request method,
endpoint, status code, and more.

## Filtering Logs

You can filter the logs based on various criteria to focus on specific types of requests. The following options are available:

- `--http-method`: Filter logs by HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST)
- `--request-path`: Filter logs by request path
- `--status-code`: Filter logs by status code
- `--api-key`: Filter logs by API key
- `--ip-address`: Filter logs by IP address

For example, to tail logs for POST requests only:

```bash
$ cobo logs tail --http-method POST
```

## Limiting the Number of Logs

By default, the `logs tail` command fetches 3 logs per request. You can adjust this using the `--limit` option:

```bash
$ cobo logs tail --limit 5
```

This will fetch 5 logs per request.

## Log Details

Each log entry provides detailed information about the API request:

- Log ID
- Timestamp
- HTTP Method
- API Endpoint
- Status Code
- IP Address
- API Key
- Query Parameters
- Request Body
- Response Body

This comprehensive information helps you understand exactly what's happening with your API requests in real-time.

## Stopping the Tail

To stop tailing logs, simply press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.

<Note>
The `logs tail` command requires appropriate authentication. Make sure you're logged in and have the necessary permissions to access the logs.

By using the `logs tail` command, you can gain valuable insights into your API usage, helping you debug issues, monitor activity, and ensure the smooth operation of your Cobo-powered applications.
