The Cobo CLI provides a convenient way to quickly open various pages of the Cobo
Portal in your default web browser. This feature helps you navigate to specific
sections of the portal without manually typing URLs.

## Usage

To open a specific page, use the `open` command followed by the target page name:

```bash
$ cobo open <target>
```

Where `<target>` is one of the available page shortcuts.

## Available Shortcuts

The following shortcuts are available:

- `portal`: Open the main Cobo Portal page
- `dashboard`: Open the Dashboard page
- `wallets`: Open the Wallets overview page
- `custodial`: Open the Custodial Wallets management page
- `mpc`: Open the MPC Wallets management page

## Examples

```bash
$ cobo open portal
```

Open the MPC Wallets management page:

```bash
$ cobo open mpc
```

Open the Developers page:

```bash
$ cobo open developer
```

## Notes

- The command will open the specified page in your default web browser.
- The URL opened will correspond to the currently set environment (development, sandbox, or production).
- If an invalid target is provided, the CLI will display an error message.
- Some targets require you to be logged in to the Cobo Portal. If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to the login page before accessing the requested page.

<Info>
You can use the `-e / --env` option to specify a different environment for the opened URL. For example:

```bash
$ cobo -e prod open dashboard 
```

This will open the dashboard in the production environment, regardless of your current CLI environment setting.
</Info>

<Note>
Targets such as `dashboard`, `wallets`, `custodial`, `mpc`, `scw`, `exchange`, `tx`, `rc`, `address`, `apps`, `org`, `members`, `fee`, `roles`, `governance`, `activities`, and `approval` require authentication. If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to the login page first.
</Note>

By using these shortcuts, you can quickly access different sections of the Cobo Portal, streamlining your workflow and saving time navigating through the web interface.
