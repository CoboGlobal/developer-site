The Cobo Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful developer tool designed to
help you build, test, and manage your integration with Cobo WaaS 2.0 directly
from the command line. With Cobo CLI, you can easily perform many common tasks
such as calling Cobo APIs, testing your webhooks integration, and managing your
wallets and transactions.

## Example usage

Here are some quick examples of how to use Cobo CLI:

1. List all Custodial Wallets:

```bash
$ cobo get /wallets --wallet_type Custodial 
```

2. Use GraphQL to query Cobo WaaS:

```bash
$ cobo graphql -q '{ 
  wallets(first: 5) { 
    edges { 
      node { 
        id 
        name 
        type 
      } 
    } 
  } 
}'
```

3. Create a new Cobo application using a template:

```bash
$ cobo app init -f nextjs -d my-cobo-app
```

4. Look up documentation for a specific API endpoint:

```bash
$ cobo doc /wallets/{wallet_id}/utxos
```

5. Monitor real-time API requests:

```bash
$ cobo logs tail --http-method GET --request-path /wallets
```

6. Trigger a webhook event:

```bash
$ cobo webhook trigger wallets.transaction.updated --override-data '{"wallet_id": "1234567890"}'
```

7. Listen for webhook events and forward them to a local endpoint:

```bash
$ cobo webhook listen --events wallets.transaction.updated --forward http://localhost:9988
```

These examples demonstrate some of the key functionalities of Cobo CLI, including REST API interactions, GraphQL queries, application management, accessing API documentation, real-time log monitoring, and webhook event handling.
