title: "Key Management"
---

This guide explains how to generate and manage API and APP keys using the Cobo
CLI. Proper key management is crucial for secure access to Cobo WaaS 2.0
services and efficient application development.

## Generate Keys

To generate a new API or APP key pair, use the `keys generate` command:

```bash
$ cobo keys generate [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `--key-type`: Specify the type of key to generate (API or APP). Default is API.
- `--alg`: Specify the key generation algorithm. Default is ed25519.
- `--force`: Force replacement of existing keys.

### Examples

Generate a new API key pair:

```bash
$ cobo keys generate
```

Generate a new APP key pair:

```bash
$ cobo keys generate --key-type APP
```

Generate a new API key pair with a specific algorithm:

```bash
$ cobo keys generate --alg rsa
```

Force replacement of existing API keys:

```bash
$ cobo keys generate --force
```

## Key Storage

Generated keys are securely stored in your environment file (default: ~/.cobo/.env). The public key is stored as `<ENV>_<KEY_TYPE>_KEY`, and the secret key is stored as `<ENV>_<KEY_TYPE>_SECRET`.

<Warning>
Never share your secret key. Keep it secure and use only the public key when configuring API access in the Cobo Portal.
</Warning>

## Using API Keys for Authentication

After generating an API key pair, follow these steps to use it for authentication with the Cobo CLI:

1. Switch to API key authentication using the following command:

```bash
$ cobo auth apikey
```

This sets the authentication method to use the API key stored in your environment file.

2. Add the newly generated API key to the Cobo Portal:
   - Log in to the Cobo Portal and navigate to the developer console.
   - Find the API Key Management page.
   - Add the newly generated API key (use the public key).
   - Grant the API key appropriate wallet scope, roles, and permissions.

<Tip>
You can quickly access the developer console by using the `cobo open developer`
command. This shortcut opens your browser and takes you directly to the right
page in the Cobo Portal. For more information on browser shortcuts, see the
[Open Browser Shortcuts](/v2/cobo-cli/utility-commands/open-browser-shortcuts)
guide.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Ensure you grant only the necessary permissions to your API key. Limiting access helps maintain the security of your account and resources.
</Warning>

3. Once you've added the API key to the Cobo Portal and set the appropriate permissions, your Cobo CLI will be able to authenticate using this key for subsequent operations.

<Note>
Remember to update the API key in the Cobo Portal's API Key management console every time you generate a new key pair using the CLI.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- Regularly rotate your API and APP keys to maintain security.
- Use different keys for different environments (development, sandbox, production).
- Limit the permissions associated with each key to the minimum required for its intended use.
- Monitor key usage and revoke any keys that may have been compromised.
