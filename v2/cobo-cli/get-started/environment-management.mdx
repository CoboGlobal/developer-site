Cobo CLI allows you to switch between different environments, such as sandbox,
development, and production. This guide helps you set up and switch between
environments effectively.

## View Current Environment

To check which environment is currently active, use:

```bash
$ cobo env
Current environment: dev
```

This command will display the name of the currently active environment.

<Info>
If you don't specify an environment, Cobo CLI defaults to the "development" environment.
</Info>

## Set Environment

To switch to a different environment, use the following command:

```bash
$ cobo env <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

Replace `<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>` with your desired environment (e.g., "dev" or
"prod"). This command will set the specified environment as the active one for
subsequent CLI commands.

## Global Environment Option

You can override the current environment for a single command by using the
global `-e` or `--env` option:

```bash
$ cobo -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> <COMMAND>
```

This allows you to execute a command in a specific environment without changing the overall active environment.

## Environment Configuration

Each environment has pre-configured API endpoints and base URLs for the Cobo portal. These configurations are set as follows:

- Sandbox: 
  - API Host: https://api.sandbox.cobo.com
  - Base URL: https://portal.sandbox.cobo.com

- Development:
  - API Host: https://api.dev.cobo.com
  - Base URL: https://portal.dev.cobo.com

- Production:
  - API Host: https://api.cobo.com
  - Base URL: https://portal.cobo.com

<Note>
Remember to switch to the correct environment before executing commands to avoid unintended actions in the wrong environment.
