title: "Login and Authentication"
---

This guide will walk you through the process of logging in, authenticating, and
managing authentication methods with the Cobo CLI. Proper authentication is
essential for securely accessing Cobo WaaS 2.0 services and managing your
resources.

## Authentication Methods

Cobo CLI supports three authentication methods:

1. API Key
2. User Access Token
3. Organization Access Token

You can switch between these methods using the `auth` command.

## User Login

To log in as a user and obtain a user access token, use the following command:

```
cobo login --user
```

This command will initiate the user login process:

1. The CLI will display a browser URL, a token URL, and a code.
2. You'll be prompted to open a browser to continue the authorization process.
3. If you confirm, your default browser will open with the provided URL.
4. Complete the authorization process in your browser, granting the necessary permissions for the Cobo CLI app to access your crypto wallets.
5. The CLI will poll the token URL for the granted token.
6. Once authenticated, your user access token will be saved in the environment file (default: ~/.cobo/.env).

## Organization Login

To log in as an organization and obtain an organization access token, use the following command:

```
cobo login --org --org-uuid <YOUR_ORG_UUID>
```

Replace `<YOUR_ORG_UUID>` with your actual organization UUID.

This command will:

1. Prompt you to open a browser for authorization.
2. Guide you through the process of granting permissions for the Cobo CLI app to access your organization's resources.
3. Retrieve and save the organization token in the environment file.

## Refreshing Organization Token

To refresh an existing organization token, add the `--refresh-token` flag:

```bash
$ cobo login --org --org-uuid <YOUR_ORG_UUID> --refresh-token
```

This command will refresh the existing token for the specified organization and update it in the environment file.

## Logout

To remove the access tokens obtained via login, use the logout command:

```bash
$ cobo logout
```

You can specify which tokens to remove:

- `cobo logout --user`: Remove only the user access token
- `cobo logout --org`: Remove only the organization access token
- `cobo logout --all`: Remove both user and organization access tokens (default behavior)

## Switching Authentication Methods

To switch between authentication methods, use the `auth` command:

```bash
$ cobo auth <METHOD>
```

Replace `<METHOD>` with one of the following:

- `apikey`: Use API Key authentication
- `user`: Use User Access Token authentication
- `org`: Use Organization Access Token authentication

For example, to switch to API Key authentication:

```bash
$ cobo auth apikey
```

To view the current authentication method:

```bash
$ cobo auth
```

## API Key Authentication

For information on generating and managing API keys, please refer to the [Key Management](/v2/cobo-cli/get-started/key-management) guide.

## Best Practices

- Keep your credentials and access tokens secure and never share them.
- Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information.
- Regularly refresh your tokens and rotate your API keys to maintain security.
- Use the appropriate authentication method based on your use case and security requirements.
