title: "Configuring Cobo CLI"
---

This guide introduces how to inspect and modify the configuration of the Cobo
CLI. The configuration is used by various Cobo CLI commands, including `cobo
env`, `cobo auth`, and `cobo keys`, to store and retrieve their respective
information.

By following this guide, you will be able to:

1. Understand the configuration file location and its purpose
2. Set configuration values
3. Retrieve configuration values
4. List all configurations
5. Delete configuration values
6. Manage important settings like environment and authentication method

## Prerequisites

- You have installed the Cobo CLI on your system. If not, refer to the [Installation guide](/v2/cobo-cli/get-started/installation).

## 1. Configuration File Location and Purpose

By default, the Cobo CLI stores its configuration in a `.env` file within the `.cobo` directory in your home directory (`~/.cobo/.env`). This file is used to store various settings that are used across different Cobo CLI commands.

You can override this location by setting the `COBO_ENV` environment variable to a different path.

## 2. Set Configuration Values

To set a configuration value, use the `set` subcommand of the `config` command:

```bash
$ cobo config set <key> <value>
```

## 3. Retrieve Configuration Values

To retrieve a configuration value, use the `get` subcommand:

```bash
$ cobo config get <key>
```

If the configuration key exists, it will display the value. Otherwise, it will inform you that the configuration was not found.

## 4. List All Configurations

To see all your current configuration settings, use the `list` subcommand:

```bash
$ cobo config list
```

This will display all key-value pairs in your configuration.

## 5. Delete Configuration Values

To remove a configuration value, use the `delete` subcommand:

```bash
$ cobo config delete <key>
```

## 6. Important Configuration Settings

While you can store any custom configuration values, there are some key settings that the Cobo CLI uses:

### Environment

The Cobo CLI supports three environments:
- `sandbox`: For testing and development
- `dev`: For development purposes
- `prod`: For production use

```bash
$ cobo config set environment sandbox
```
<Note>
This has the same effect as running `cobo env sandbox`.
</Note>

### Authentication Method

The CLI supports three authentication methods:
- `apikey`: For API key-based authentication
- `user`: For user-based authentication
- `org`: For organization-based authentication

```bash
$ cobo config set auth_method apikey
```
<Note>
This has the same effect as running `cobo auth apikey`.
