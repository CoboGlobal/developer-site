title: 'Trigger Webhook Events'
---

The Cobo CLI provides a convenient way to trigger test webhook events, allowing
you to simulate various scenarios and test your webhook integration without
affecting real data.

## Usage

To trigger a test webhook event, use the following command:

```bash
$ cobo webhook trigger <event_type> [--override <json_string>]
```

### Parameters

- `<event_type>`: The type of webhook event you want to trigger. This is a required parameter.
- `--override <json_string>`: (Optional) A JSON string to override specific fields in the event payload.

## Supported Event Types

The Cobo CLI supports triggering the following webhook event types:

- `wallets.transaction.created`
- `wallets.transaction.updated`
- `wallets.transaction.failed`
- `wallets.transaction.succeeded`
- `wallets.mpc.tss_request.created`
- `wallets.mpc.tss_request.updated`
- `wallets.mpc.tss_request.failed`
- `wallets.mpc.tss_request.succeeded`

<Note>
  To get the most up-to-date list of supported event types, you can use the
  `cobo webhook events` command.
</Note>

## Examples

### Trigger a simple event

To trigger a `wallets.transaction.created` event with default data:

```bash
$ cobo webhook trigger wallets.transaction.created
```

### Trigger an event with custom data

To trigger a `wallets.transaction.updated` event with custom data:

```bash
$ cobo webhook trigger wallets.transaction.updated --override '{"chain_id": "ETH", "amount": "1000000000000000000"}'
```

This command will trigger a `wallets.transaction.updated` event with the specified `chain_id` and `amount` values, while using default values for other fields.

## Response

After triggering an event, the CLI will display the event details, including:

- Event ID
- Event Type
- Timestamp
- Event Data

Example response:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_1234567890abcdef",
  "type": "wallets.transaction.created",
  "created_timestamp": 1701396866000,
  "data": {
    "chain_id": "ETH",
    "amount": "1000000000000000000",
    "status": "Pending"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test all event types**: Trigger events for all the webhook types your application is subscribed to, ensuring your system can handle each type correctly.

2. **Use realistic data**: When overriding event data, try to use realistic values that match your production scenarios.

3. **Test error handling**: Trigger events with edge case data to ensure your webhook consumer can handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.

4. **Verify webhook delivery**: After triggering an event, check your webhook endpoint logs to confirm that the event was received and processed correctly.

By using the Cobo CLI's webhook trigger feature, you can thoroughly test your webhook integration, ensuring that your application is ready to handle real webhook events in a production environment.
