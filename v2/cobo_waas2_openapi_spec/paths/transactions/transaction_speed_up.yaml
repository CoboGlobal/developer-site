  summary: Speed up transaction
  description: |
    This operation accelerates a specified transaction. 

    Speeding up a transaction will trigger an RBF transaction which is a new version of the original transaction. It shares the same inputs but has a higher transaction fee to incentivize miners to prioritize its confirmation over the previous one. A transaction can be accelerated if its status is either `Broadcasting`.
    
    A transaction request for tracking is returned upon successful operation.
