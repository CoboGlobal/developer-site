  summary: Call smart contract
  description: |
    This operation creates a transaction to interact with a smart contract on the blockchain.

    You need to provide details such as the source address, destination address, and the calldata. You can specify the fee-related properties to limit the transaction fee. A transaction request for tracking is returned upon successful operation.
    
    Currently, this operation only applies to blockchains that have a similar architecture to Ethereum.
