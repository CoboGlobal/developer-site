  summary: Drop transaction
  description: |
    This operation drops a specified transaction. 

    Dropping a transaction will trigger a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction which is a new version of the original transaction. For EVM chains, this RBF transaction has a transfer amount of `0` and the sending address is the same as the receiving address. It has a higher transaction fee to incentivize miners to prioritize its confirmation over the previous one. A transaction can be dropped if its status is `Broadcasting`.

    A transaction request for tracking is returned upon successful operation.
