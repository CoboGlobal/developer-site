  operationId: create_message_sign_transaction
  summary: Sign message
  description: |
    This operation creates a transaction to sign the provided message using cryptographic techniques.

    In some scenarios, you want to sign a message for identity authentication or transaction approval. You need to provide details such as the source address, destination address, and the message to be signed. A transaction request for tracking is returned upon successful operation.

    Currently, only MPC Wallets support this type of transaction to sign a message.
