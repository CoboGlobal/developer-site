  The status of the key share holder group. Possible values include:
  - `New`: The key share holder group has been newly created. The status will become `Valid` after you call [Create TSS request](/api-references/v2/wallets--mpc-wallet/create-a-tss-request-to-generate-key-secrets-for-a-tss-group) and specifying this key share holder group as the target key share holder group.
  
  - `Valid`: The key share holder group is valid.
  
  - `Unavailable`: The key share holder group is currently unavailable. This status appears when a key share holder uses [mobile co-signer](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/back-up-key-share-groups#mobile-co-signer) to change node. For example, when a key share holder changes to a new phone or loses their phone, and is in the process of setting up [Cobo Guard](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/guard/introduction) on their new phone.
