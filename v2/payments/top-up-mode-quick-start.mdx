## Prerequisites

You have completed all steps mentioned in the [Preparation](/v2/payments/preparation).

## Steps

### 1. Create a Payer

1. Log in to Cobo Portal [Development Environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login) or [Production Environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click **Apps** in the left navigation bar, then click the **Payment Management** card to launch the App.
3. Click **Top-up** in the App's left navigation bar.
4. Click the **Create Payer** button in the top right corner.

   - Select the token and network. Cobo will create a dedicated top-up address on this network for the payer. After creating the payer, you can create more top-up addresses on other networks for this payer to support multi-chain top-ups.
   - Enter a custom payer ID. This ID must be the unique identifier for this payer in your system.
5. Click **Create** to complete the payer creation.
