## A

### Acquiring Type

Acquiring type refers to the method of receiving cryptocurrency payments from users. The Cobo Payment Solution supports two acquiring types:

- Top-up mode: Cobo generates a dedicated top-up address for each user, and users can top up any amount to that address at any time.
- Order mode: Cobo creates a payment order with a specified amount and expiration date, and users need to pay the exact amount to the specified address within the specified time.

## B

### Balance

Balance refers to the total amount of all funds in an account at a specific point in time. In the Cobo Payment Solution, balances are categorized into the following two types:

- **Merchant balance**: The total amount of funds belonging to merchants, mainly derived from the merchant portion of top-up amounts and order actual received amounts.
- **Developer balance**: The total amount of funds belonging to developers, mainly derived from the following sources:
  - The developer portion of top-up amounts and order actual received amounts
  - Developer fees collected from merchants during the refund process
  - Funds transferred from external wallets to Cobo Portal

For detailed balance definitions, please refer to [Amount definitions and balance calculation explanations](/v2/payments/amounts-and-balances).

## C

### Cobo KYT

Cobo's Know Your Transaction (KYT) compliance screening service, used to identify and prevent suspicious or high-risk transactions.

### Crypto Withdrawal

The process of transferring cryptocurrency to specified external wallet addresses. In the Cobo Payment Solution, you can choose crypto withdrawal as a settlement method for quick fund extraction.

### Custodial Wallet

Cobo's Custodial Wallets are digital asset management solutions designed specifically for institutional customers. Cobo is responsible for securely storing and managing [private keys](/v2/payments/glossary#private-key), combining risk control engines, hardware security modules (HSMs), and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology to provide comprehensive security protection for customer assets.

Custodial Wallets support both Asset Wallets and Web3 Wallets. The Cobo Payment Solution uses Web3 Wallets, allocating dedicated addresses for each customer to avoid sharing addresses with other users, ensuring clear and traceable fund sources and supporting whitelisting by third-party institutions.

## D

### Deposit Transaction

The act of transferring crypto assets to an address on a blockchain network.

### Developer

Institutions that integrate the Cobo Payment Solution, including payment service providers (PSPs), e-commerce platforms, gaming platforms, direct-to-consumer (DTC) websites, etc.

If you are a merchant that directly serves payers (such as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) website), you are also a developer. Such developers do not need to configure developer fees and only need to create one merchant (yourself) in the system.

### Developer Fee

If you are an institution such as a PSP or e-commerce platform that needs to serve downstream merchants, you can charge handling fees to downstream merchants by specifying developer fees. If you are a merchant that directly serves payers (such as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) website), you do not need to configure developer fees.

## G

### Gas Fee

The transaction fee required to execute transactions on blockchain networks, used to pay for the computational and storage resource consumption of blockchain networks. Different blockchain networks have different gas fee calculation methods and charging standards, and fees change dynamically with network congestion levels. Also called on-chain fees or miner fees.

## K

### Know Your Transaction (KYT)

A transaction monitoring and risk assessment tool used to analyze the sources and flows of blockchain transactions to identify suspicious or high-risk transactions. KYT scanning helps institutions meet compliance requirements and prevent financial crimes by tracking fund flows and assessing counterparty risks.

## M

### Merchant

Institutions that provide goods or services to payers and receive payment. Merchants can receive payments through third-party platforms such as PSPs and e-commerce platforms, or directly use the Cobo Payment Solution to receive payments directly through direct-to-consumer (DTC) websites and other forms.

### MPC Wallet

Cobo's MPC Wallets use multi-party computation (MPC) technology, allowing you to have complete control over private keys and achieve asset self-custody. Through MPC technology, private keys are distributed and stored in multiple independent secure environments, ensuring both asset security and transaction flexibility. Note that you need to manage private key security yourself and bear corresponding risks.

## O

### Off-Ramp

The process of converting cryptocurrency to fiat currency and then transferring to specified bank accounts. In the Cobo Payment Solution, you can choose fiat off-ramp as a settlement method.

### On-Ramp

The process of converting fiat currency to cryptocurrency and then transferring to specified addresses.

### Order Mode

An acquiring type. In order mode, Cobo creates a payment order with a specified amount and expiration date, and users need to pay the exact amount to the specified address within the specified time.

## P

### Payer

The party that pays merchants for goods or services, including individual consumers, corporate customers, purchasers, etc. In this documentation, payers are also referred to as users.

### Pay-In Order

In order mode, order records created by Cobo to collect payments. Each pay-in order contains information such as specified payment amount, payment currency, and expiration date.

### Private Key

The unique key in cryptocurrency wallets used to control and manage digital assets. A private key is a randomly generated combination of numbers and letters used to prove asset ownership and authorize transactions. When making transfer transactions, the system uses the private key to generate digital signatures to verify transaction legitimacy. Once a private key is lost or stolen, you will permanently lose access to your assets.

## S

### Sweep

The process of automatically or manually transferring funds from multiple receiving addresses to a sweep-to address. In the Cobo Payment Solution, when the balance on a receiving address exceeds the sweep threshold, the system automatically executes the sweep operation. Swept funds can be used for settlement or refund processing. You can also initiate a forced sweep through the API to manually sweep funds below the threshold to the sweep-to address.

### Sweep Threshold 

The minimum balance requirement that triggers automatic sweep operations.

- When the balance on a receiving address equals or exceeds the sweep threshold: Cobo will automatically sweep the funds to the sweep address when you initiate settlement or refund. These funds are included in the available balance (`available_balance`).
- When the balance on a receiving address is below the sweep threshold: Funds remain at the receiving address and are not included in the available balance, but only in the total balance (`total_balance`).

You can query the difference between available balance and total balance through the API, and use the forced sweep feature to manually sweep funds below the threshold to make them available for settlement or refund.

## R

### Receiving Address

A blockchain address used to receive crypto assets.

### Refund Order

In order mode, order records created by Cobo to refund funds to users. Each refund order contains information such as specified refund amount and refund currency.

## T

### Top-Up Address

In top-up mode, the dedicated receiving address allocated by Cobo for each user. Users can transfer any amount of cryptocurrency to that address at any time.

### Top-Up Mode

An acquiring type. In top-up mode, Cobo generates a dedicated top-up address for each user, and users can top up any amount to that address at any time.
