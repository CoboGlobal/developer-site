This document explains the definitions of various amounts in the payment collection, refund, and settlement processes, as well as balance calculation formulas.

## Merchant funds and developer funds

Cobo maintains separate income and expense records for two types of funds: merchant funds and developer funds.

* Merchant funds: Funds belonging to various merchants, mainly derived from the merchant portion of top-up amounts and order actual received amounts.
* Developer funds: Funds belonging to developers, mainly including the following sources:
  * The developer portion of top-up amounts and order actual received amounts
  * Developer fees collected from merchants during the refund process
  * Funds transferred from external wallets to Cobo Portal

In top-up mode, Cobo will automatically divide each incoming top-up amount into merchant funds and developer funds based on the developer fee rate (`developer_fee_rate`) you set when creating the merchant. For example, when you set the developer fee rate to 1%, Cobo will divide a 100 USDT top-up amount into 99 USDT of merchant funds and 1 USDT of developer funds.

In order mode, Cobo will automatically divide the order actual received amount into merchant actual received amount and developer fees based on the ratio between the order amount (`order_amount`) and developer fee (`fee_amount`) you pass in when creating the order. For example, when `order_amount` is 99 USDT and `fee_amount` is 1 USDT, Cobo will divide a 100 USDT order actual received amount into 99 USDT of merchant actual received amount and 1 USDT of developer fees.

<Note>In cases of [overpayment and underpayment](/v2/payments/handle-abnormality-order#abnormal-payment-situations-explanation), Cobo will divide related funds into merchant funds and developer funds at the above-mentioned ratio. Late payment funds will be completely allocated to developer funds.</Note>

## Merchant withdrawable balance

**Merchant withdrawable balance** refers to the total amount of funds available for a specific merchant to initiate settlement at a specific moment. Cobo calculates merchant withdrawable balances separately for top-up mode and order mode, and this balance can be queried through [Get withdrawable balances](/v2/api-references/payment/get-withdrawable-balances).

The calculation formula for this amount is: **Total merchant received amount** - **Merchant non-withdrawable amount** - **Merchant settled amount** - **Merchant refunded amount** - **Merchant under review/isolated/frozen amount**.

* **Total merchant received amount**: In top-up mode, this amount is the total merchant funds from all top-ups received by the merchant; in order mode, this amount is the total merchant funds from the actual received amounts of all pay-in orders for the merchant.
* **Merchant non-withdrawable amount**: If the balance on a certain address is below the minimum sweep amount specified by Cobo, this portion of the balance will be considered non-withdrawable. If you need to settle non-withdrawable amounts, you must contact Cobo's support team through [help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com) to initiate a manual sweep request, and then initiate settlement after completion.
* **Merchant settled amount**: The total amount of merchant funds that have been settled.
* **Merchant refunded amount**: The total amount of merchant funds that have been refunded to users.
* **Under review/isolated/frozen amount**: The total amount of merchant funds that have been included in actual received amounts but have not passed compliance screening and are currently in manual review, isolated, or frozen status.

## Developer withdrawable balance

**Developer withdrawable balance** refers to the total amount of funds available for developers to initiate settlement at a specific moment. Cobo calculates developer withdrawable balances separately for top-up mode and order mode, and this balance can be queried through [Get withdrawable balances](/v2/api-references/payment/get-withdrawable-balances).

**Developer withdrawable balance** includes the following fund sources:

* **Developer fees**: In top-up mode, this amount is the developer fees from all top-ups received by the merchant; in order mode, this amount is the developer fees from the actual received amounts of all pay-in orders for the merchant.
* **Refund handling fees**: Developer fees you collect from merchants in refund orders.
* Funds you transfer from external wallets to Cobo Portal

The following amounts will be deducted during calculation:

* **Non-withdrawable amount**: If the balance on a certain address is below the minimum sweep amount specified by Cobo, this portion of the balance will be considered non-withdrawable. If you need to settle non-withdrawable amounts, you must contact Cobo's support team through [help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com).
* **Settled amount**: The total amount of developer funds that have been settled
* **Refunded amount**: The total amount of developer funds that have been refunded to users
* Funds transferred to external wallets: Funds you transfer from Cobo Portal to external wallets
* **Under review/isolated/frozen amount**: The total amount of developer funds that have been included in actual received amounts but have not passed compliance screening and are currently in manual review, isolated, or frozen status
