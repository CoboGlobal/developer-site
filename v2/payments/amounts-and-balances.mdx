This article explains the definitions of various amounts during payment processing, refunds, and settlements, as well as the balance calculation formulas.

## Merchant Funds and Developer Funds

Cobo maintains separate accounting records for two types of funds: merchant funds and developer funds.

* **Merchant funds**: Funds belonging to individual merchants, primarily sourced from top-up amounts and the merchant portion of actual order receipts.  
* **Developer funds**: Funds belonging to the developer, mainly including the following sources:  
  * The developer portion of top-up amounts and actual order receipts;  
  * Developer fees charged to merchants during the refund process;
  * Funds transferred from external wallets to Cobo Portal.

In top-up mode, Cobo automatically divides each incoming top-up amount into merchant funds and developer funds based on the developer fee rate (`developer_fee_rate`) you set when creating the merchant. For example, when you set a developer fee rate of 1%, Cobo will divide a 100 USDT top-up into 99 USDT of merchant funds and 1 USDT of developer funds.

In order mode, Cobo automatically divides the actual order receipt amount into merchant actual receipts and developer fees based on the ratio between the product order amount (`order_amount`) and developer fee (`fee_amount`) you pass when creating the order. For example, when `order_amount` is 99 USDT and `fee_amount` is 1 USDT, Cobo will divide the 100 USDT actual order receipt into 99 USDT of merchant actual receipt and 1 USDT of developer fee.

<Note>In cases of [overpayment and underpayment](/v2_cn/payments/handle-abnormality-order#异常支付情况说明), Cobo will divide the related funds into merchant funds and developer funds according to the above ratio. Late payment funds will be entirely allocated to developer funds.</Note>

## Merchant Balance

**Merchant balance** refers to the total amount of funds available to a specific merchant at a given time for initiating settlements or refunds. Cobo calculates merchant balances separately for top-up mode and order mode, and this balance can be queried through [List merchant balances](/v2/api-references/payment/list-merchant-balances).

The calculation formula is: **Total Merchant Actual Receipts** - **Merchant Settled Amount** - **Merchant Refunded Amount** - **Merchant Under Review/Isolated/Frozen Amount**.

* **Total Merchant Actual Receipts**: In top-up mode, this is the total amount of merchant funds from all top-ups received by the merchant; in order mode, this is the total amount of merchant funds from actual receipts of all payment orders for the merchant.
* **Merchant Settled Amount**: The total amount of merchant funds that have been settled.  
* **Merchant Refunded Amount**: The total amount of merchant funds that have been refunded to users.  
* **Under Review/Isolated/Frozen Amount**: Merchant funds that have been included in actual receipts but have not passed compliance scanning and are currently under manual review, isolated, or frozen.

## Developer Balance

**Developer balance** refers to the total amount of funds available to the developer at a given time for initiating settlements or refunds. Cobo calculates developer balances separately for top-up mode and order mode, and this balance can be queried through [Get developer balance](/v2/api-references/payment/get-developer-balance).

**Developer balance** includes the following funding sources:

* **Developer fees**: In top-up mode, this is the developer fees from all top-ups received by the merchant; in order mode, this is the developer fees from actual receipts of all payment orders for the merchant.
* **Refund processing fees**: Developer fees you charge to merchants in refund orders.
* Funds you transfer from external wallets to Cobo Portal

The following amounts are deducted during calculation:

* **Settled amount**: The total amount of developer funds that have been settled  
* **Refunded amount**: The total amount of developer funds that have been refunded to users
* Funds transferred to external wallets: Funds you transfer from Cobo Portal to external wallets  
* **Under review/isolated/frozen amount**: Developer funds that have been included in actual receipts but have not passed compliance scanning and are currently under manual review, isolated, or frozen
