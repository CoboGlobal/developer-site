After completing functionality verification by following the [Development Environment Preparation](/v2/payments/preparation) and ensuring all features work properly, you need to repeat the same configuration process in the production environment. Additionally, the production environment requires extra configurations to meet business requirements and security needs, such as risk control settings and adding public chains.

This article will guide you through the specific configurations required for the production environment. You can access the Cobo Portal production environment at [https://portal.cobo.com/login](https://portal.cobo.com/login).

## Business Configuration

### Add Chains

In the production environment, only some commonly used public chains are activated by default. Before starting, please first confirm in Cobo Portal whether the public chains required for your business are activated. If the chains you need are not activated, you need to manually add them to your team configuration. Here are the steps:

   1. Log in to Cobo Portal [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
   2. Click the profile icon in the lower left corner, then click **Plans**.
   3. Navigate to **Available Chains** and click the **Manage** icon.

   4. On the **Manage** page, review the list of available chains. If the chain you need is not in the list, click **Add Chain** to add more chains for your team.

   <Info>To view the complete list of tokens and chains supported by Cobo, please refer to [Supported Tokens and Chains](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/supported-tokens-and-chains).</Info>


### Enable Cobo KYT
Cobo KYT is Cobo's Know Your Transaction (KYT) compliance scanning service, used to identify and prevent suspicious or high-risk transactions.

* **Custodial Wallet**: Cobo KYT service is enabled by default, no additional configuration needed.
* **MPC Wallet**: You can:
    - Contact Cobo sales team to enable Cobo KYT service
    - Or perform compliance scanning on funds yourself through the [Screening App](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/screening/introduction), and handle transactions that fail the screening.

## Security Configuration
### Risk Control Configuration

Cobo Portal provides various risk control mechanisms designed to enhance security when storing, managing, and transferring cryptocurrencies.

#### User Roles and Permissions

User roles consist of predefined rules that can be used to assign specific permissions to designated members within the team.

- Configure at least 2 administrators for cross-validation and backup purposes. Other roles should be properly configured based on actual needs.
- It is not recommended to assign multiple roles to the same member.

For more details, please refer to [User Roles and Permissions](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions).

#### Transaction Risk Control

Transaction risk control is one of the important security measures for your team. It is recommended to strictly configure transaction risk control policies, especially in large withdrawal scenarios. Special attention should be paid to token transfer policies in off-chain transaction risk control to avoid high-risk situations, such as:
- No risk control rules set
- Transactions not covered by transaction risk control
- All transactions automatically approved
- Same role can both initiate withdrawals and approve them

For more details, please refer to [Transaction Risk Control Overview](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview).

#### Business Risk Control

Business risk control determines the approval rules for approving or rejecting certain operations.

The following operations are important in Cobo Portal, and it is recommended to configure approval from 2 or more [administrators](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions).
- Invite members
- Change member user roles
- Edit business risk control
- Manage transaction risk control
- Manage addresses in address list
- Cobo Portal Apps authorization
- Change Cobo Portal Apps permissions
- Change Cobo Portal Apps approval flow
- Manage API Keys
- Edit custom user roles

For more details, please refer to [Business Risk Control Introduction](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/organization/governance-intro).

### Administrator Authentication
To enhance security and reduce the risk of account theft, it is strongly recommended that all administrators enable at least two authentication methods, with Cobo Guard being one of them.

Recommended combinations include:
- Cobo Guard and Google Authenticator (GA)
- Cobo Guard and Security Key

<Note>It is recommended to install GA on a different device from Cobo Guard to avoid being unable to access your account due to the loss of a single device.</Note>

### API Key Settings

When registering API Keys in the production environment, please note:

   * **User Role**: Based on business needs, choose either **Payment Administrator** or **Payment Member**. You can refer to [User Roles and Permissions](/v2/payments/roles-and-permissions) to understand the permissions for different roles.
   * **Wallet Scope**: It is recommended to only select the specific wallet types you actually need to access. For example, if you only use custodial wallets, only select **Custodial Wallet**. You can adjust the wallet scope anytime based on business development needs to ensure API access permissions follow the principle of least privilege.
   * You do not need to configure a Callback Endpoint.
   * **Key Type**: Select **Permanent (Static IP Required)** and set IP whitelisting.


### Payment Management App Settings

When installing the Payment Management App, it is recommended to only select the specific **Wallet Scope** that you actually need to access. For example, if you only use custodial wallets, only select **Custodial Wallet**. You can adjust the wallet scope anytime based on business development needs to ensure API access permissions follow the principle of least privilege.

### MPC Wallet Configuration

If you are using an MPC wallet, you will need to create an MPC Vault and complete the key share configuration.

<Note>To understand Vaults, key shares, and other related concepts, please refer to [Organization Wallet Introduction](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/introduction).</Note>

#### 1. Create Main Group

A group of key share holders is called a [Holder Group](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-overview). The Main Group is the first holder group you create before using MPC wallets.

The diagram below shows a Main Group containing two key share holders. Cobo holds one key share, while your team holds the other.

<img src="/v2/images/payments/key-shares.svg" className="diagram" alt="Key shares"/>

Follow these steps to create a Main Group in Cobo Portal:
1. Log in to Cobo Portal [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/v2/images/guides/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Click **Create Vault**. Follow the interface guide to complete Vault creation.
4. After creating the Vault, the **Generate Main Group Key Share** dialog will automatically pop up. In the dialog, navigate to the **Key Share Holder 2** section and configure the holder. For detailed information about signer types and their settings, please refer to [Signer Types](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group#signer-type).

    - Using Mobile Co-Signer: Select a holder from the dropdown list. The **TSS Node ID** field will be automatically populated. Click **Confirm**.
    - Using Server Co-Signer: Enter the holder name, fill in the TSS Node ID, then click **Confirm**.

5. Confirm that you initiated this request in your Cobo Guard application.

#### 2. Generate Key Shares

After creating the Main Group, the next crucial step is generating key shares. This process varies depending on your signer type:

* For Mobile Co-Signer:
  - Wait for the **1 key share needs to be generated** popup message to appear on Cobo Guard (this may take a few seconds).
  - Click the popup message to open the key generation interface.
  - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the key share generation process.
  - We recommend backing up your key share at this time for increased security. However, you can choose to do this step after completing this guide.

* For Server Co-Signer:
  * Ensure the TSS Node server is brought online within 24 hours. When the server comes online, the key share generation process will start automatically.
  * If a [TSS Node callback server](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/callback-server-overview) is configured, the generation process will only begin after the callback server approves.

Once the key generation process is complete, the holder group status will change to **Active** on Cobo Portal. You may need to refresh the Cobo Portal page to see the updated result.

#### 3. Key Share Backup and Recovery

After generating key shares, you can back up the key share files to ensure the security and recoverability of key shares. Please securely store the recovery passphrase and encrypted database password for the key share backup. If lost, you will need to use the Recovery Group to recover key shares (if a Recovery Group has been set up).

For more details, please refer to [Mobile Co-Signer key share backup instructions](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/guard/generate-and-back-up-key-shares#back-up-key-shares) and [Server Co-Signer key share backup instructions](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/key-shares-backup).

#### 4. Other Holder Group Configurations

- **Holder Group Configuration**: In addition to the Main Group, you need to create at least one Signing Group and one Recovery Group. It is strongly recommended not to have the same key share holder (i.e., with the same [TSS Node ID](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/glossary#tss-node)) belong to different types of holder groups simultaneously, for example, belonging to both the Main Group and a Signing Group. If this occurs, ensure there is more than one Signing Group.
- **Signer Type**: Since there may be many [sweep](/v2/payments/glossary#sweep) transactions before settlement and transactions are concentrated in time, ensure you set up a [Server Co-Signer](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/tss-node-overview) in your [Main Group](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group) or [Signing Group](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-signing-group) to enable automated signing.
- **Risk Control Configuration**: If you choose to use [TSS Node callback](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/callback-server-overview) as your Server Co-Signer's risk control mechanism, you need to add your wallet's sweep address to the callback server's whitelist. After adding, the Server Co-Signer will automatically sign withdrawal transactions from the sweep address during settlement or refund. For detailed whitelist configuration methods, please refer to [Risk Control Best Practices - Automated Sweep Implementation](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/risk-control-best-practices#automated-sweep-implementation). You can view a wallet's sweep address under the wallet's **Addresses** → **Sweep To** tab.<img src="/v2/images/payments/auto-sweep-address-list.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Wallet sweep address list" />
