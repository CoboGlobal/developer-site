Subscription mode is suitable for scenarios that require regular collection of fixed amounts, such as membership fees, subscription fees, etc. In this mode, Cobo implements the following functions through smart contracts:

- **Automatic deduction**: Automatically deduct the specified amount from the payer's wallet according to the subscription cycle
- **Flexible configuration**: Supports setting deduction cycles and deduction amounts. Cycles support monthly, quarterly, and annual.
- **Secure and controllable**: Payers can cancel authorization at any time to terminate subsequent deductions

If you need to understand the specific integration steps and technical details, please contact the Cobo sales team for more information.
