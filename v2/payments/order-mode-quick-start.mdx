## Prerequisites

- You have completed all steps mentioned in the [Preparation](/v2/payments/preparation).

- Create an order and complete the payment. Currently, the App does not support order creation. You can create orders through these two methods:
  - Using API: Refer to the [Create Orders](/v2/payments/create-orders) documentation to create orders via API.
  - Using Checkout SDK: Refer to the [Integrate Checkout SDK](/v2/payments/checkout-sdk) documentation to quickly develop a secure and reliable cryptocurrency payment page through simple iFrame integration.


## Steps

### 1. View Order Details

After creating an order, you can view the order details in the Payment Management App.

1. Log in to Cobo Portal [Development Environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login) or [Production Environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click **Apps** in the left navigation bar, then click the **Payment Management** card to launch the App.
3. Click **Orders** in the App's left navigation bar. You can view detailed information for all orders on this page, such as order ID, merchant information, payment amount, order status, etc.
4. When the user completes payment and the transaction passes compliance screening, the order status will change to **Completed**. At this point, you can proceed with settlement for this order.
