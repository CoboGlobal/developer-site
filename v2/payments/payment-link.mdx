A Payment Link is essentially a URL with a token, where each token is uniquely bound to an order, in the format:  
`https://checkout.cobo.com/payment?token=xxx`

Payment Links are generated by the developer's backend by calling the Cobo WaaS API and returned to the developer's frontend. The developer's frontend can either redirect directly or embed it in an iframe.

End users can complete the payment process through the Payment Link. Third-party wallet integration is handled entirely by Cobo, currently supporting EVM, Tron, and Solana chains, covering both PC wallet extensions and mobile wallet apps.


## Payment Link Integration Process

Cobo provides an integration demo: [https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-checkout-sdk-demo](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-checkout-sdk-demo)

The demo includes sample code for both developer frontend and backend, implemented in JavaScript for quick demonstration purposes. In actual scenarios, developers can freely choose the Cobo WaaS SDK in their preferred language for the backend.

Frontend code is located at: `src/main.ts`  
Backend code is located at: `server.js`

First, you need to bind and activate your API Key in Cobo Portal, then enter your API Key and API Secret in `server.js` (if you've already integrated the legacy Checkout SDK, you can reuse the same API Key and API Secret).

Then run the following commands:

```shell
// Install dependencies
pnpm install
// Run both frontend and backend
npm run start
```

Open in browser: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

The demo provides two methods: Pay Now (By New Window) is URL mode, which opens a new browser tab; Pay Now (By iframe) is iframe mode, which embeds in the current page.

Choose either method and click Pay Now to see the following request, simulating the pre-order creation flow: PSP frontend calls PSP backend, PSP backend calls Cobo WaaS API, and returns the generated Payment Link to PSP frontend.


## Payment Link Demo

### 1. Opening Payment Link on PC

After opening the Payment Link on PC, the page appears as follows:

### 2. PC Wallet Selection

When end users connect a third-party wallet, all supported wallet extensions are dynamically displayed (depending on the browser extensions actually installed by the end user), as shown below:

### 3. Opening Payment Link on Mobile

After opening the Payment Link on mobile, the page appears as follows:

<img src="/v2/images/payments/payment-link-mobile-page.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Mobile Payment Link Page" />

### 4. Mobile Wallet Selection

When end users connect a third-party wallet, all supported wallet apps are statically listed (regardless of whether the end user has installed the respective apps), as shown below:
