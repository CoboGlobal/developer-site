Before performing off-ramp or crypto payouts, you need to first register receiving destinations, including:

- **Crypto payout addresses**: Used to receive crypto payouts
- **Bank accounts**: Used to receive fiat


## Register bank account

Use Payments App to register a bank account. Funds will be converted to fiat currency and transferred to this account.

1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login) or [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. In the left navigation bar, click **Apps**, then click the **Payments** card to launch the App.
3. In the App's left navigation bar, click **Bank Accounts**.
2. Click the **Add Bank Account** button in the upper right corner.
3. In the pop-up form, fill in information such as bank account alias, account number, SWIFT/BIC code, beneficiary name, and beneficiary address.
4. After clicking **Submit**, notify the Cobo operations team for review.


## Register crypto payout address

- When performing crypto payouts using Payments App, you can directly fill in the receiving address without registering in advance.

- You can also call [Create crypto address](/v2/api-references/payment/create-crypto-address) to register. After registration, you can use this address for crypto payouts.
